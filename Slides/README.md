## Codes
Itcontains PowerPoint presentations that we use to teach the material for each section. These slides provide an overview of the concepts covered in that section, as well as code snippets and diagrams to help explain the concepts.

## Content

### Basics: 
You'll learn about the basics of microcontrollers and how they're used in Arduino boards. We'll show you the different types of Arduino boards available and their features, so you can choose the best one for your project.

### Fundamentals: 
we'll introduce you to the world of electronics and programming. You'll learn the basics of programming and how to use the Arduino IDE. We'll also show you some simple applications, like LED blinking and push buttons, to help you get started.

### Sensors:
You'll learn how to interface with different types of sensors, including LDR, Ultrasonic, DHT, and IR sensors. You'll learn how to read data from the sensors and display it in the serial monitor, so you can use this information to control your projects.

### Actuators:
You'll discover the different types of motors and how to control each one of them. You'll also learn how to choose the right type of motor for your project, based on your application.

### Communication:
You'll learn how to use the serial monitor and how to send and receive data between your laptop and the Arduino board. You'll also learn about the Bluetooth protocol and build an application to control an LED.

### Display:
You'll learn how to use LCDs and seven segment displays to communicate with your users. You'll learn how to display different types of information, including animation and text scrolling, to create more interactive projects.
